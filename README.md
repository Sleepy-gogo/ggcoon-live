## üìå What is GGCoon.live?

This is a simple Twitch Clone, made for learning purposes. Feel free to fork this repo, and add your own features, or just use it as a starter for your own project.

## ‚öô How to use it?

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Or any other package manager of your liking)
- [Prisma CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/tools/prisma-cli#installation)

And that you have an account on:

- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/)
- [Uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sleepy-gogo/ggcoon-live.git

cd ggcoon-live

npm install # (Or any other package manager equivalent command)
```

2. Setup your environment:

- Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Update the file with your own values.

#### Clerk

Clerk has a quick **Next.js** setup to get your _public_ and _secret keys_.

When creating the **Clerk Webhook**, make sure you point to the right endpoint, _https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/clerk_, as well as listen **only** to _user events_.

#### Livekit

You can also generate your _API keys_ in the settings tab on **Livekit**. Follow the indicated format in the example for the wss and api url.

**Livekit** is fully open-source, and allows for self-hosting. See the [livekit.io](https://docs.livekit.io/realtime/self-hosting/) documentation for more information.

#### Uploadthing

Create your app in [Uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/), then go to the **API Keys** tab, and copy your secret and app ip onto the .env file.

3. Ensure you have the Prisma CLI installed, run the migrations, then generate the prisma client:

```bash
npm install prisma -g

npx prisma migrate dev

npx prisma generate
```

### Usage

You can run the development server normally by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or start the production server by running:

```bash

```
